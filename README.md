# Incog.ly


Have you ever been in a situation where you nailed every aspect of the conversation but still couldn't crack the deal. Maybe because the other person had a bias against you :eyes:

We created Incog.ly to help everyone remove that component of uncertainity in our new routines.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Features

1. Peer to Peer Connection
2. Face and Emotion detection to simulate real conversations.
3. Face and Audio masking for complete anonymity
4. Clean UI <3
5. **Actively under development**

### Why Incog.ly?

Incog.ly is a video platform where candidate's and interviewee's face and voice are masked during the interview. This allows the interviewers to understand the candidate's experience and abilities while eliminating their identity from the evaluation process.

## Requirements

Some developer skills. ;)
Have an eye for the best project :eyes:
